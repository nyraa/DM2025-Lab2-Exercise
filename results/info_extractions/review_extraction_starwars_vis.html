MOVIE REVIEW — Star Wars Episode IX: The
Rise of Skywalker
A Messy Finale 42 Years in the Making — ★★★☆☆

The Dead Speak! These are the first words seen in the title crawl of Star Wars Episode
IX (other than the title, obviously) and that one sentence can be applied to the
entirety of this Disney Era of Star Wars. <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">A seemingly dead film franchise brought
back from an early 2000’s extinction</span> at the hands of series creator George Lucas with
the prequel trilogy. Nothing’s ever really gone though, and so here we are. Five years
removed from the arrival of J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens in 2014 and we now have
a total of five new entries into the Star Wars franchise, as well as the arrival of new
shows such as The Mandalorian on Disney+. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Opinions vary on this new set of films</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
from love, hate, and totally indifferent, but one thing is certain; everyone has an
opinion. The difference between the Original and Prequel Trilogies and the Sequel
Trilogy is their release date. The former were released in times when social media
was either not in existence or not prominent at all, whereas with the newest movies,
fans are able to share their thoughts, both negative and positive, in an instant. This
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">lead to the infamous outspoken hatred</span> for Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi from a vocal
subset of fans and the rest is history. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Star Wars fans have now all been labeled as
trashy misogynistic man-children</span> fighting with each other over their supposed
ownership and love of the series. With the fanbase divided headed into the grand
finale of the Skywalker Saga, what would J.J. Abrams do to try and bring things
home? If you have seen it, you already know, so let’s just get right into it. Here are
my thoughts after seeing Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker twice (once in
digital and once in IMAX)!
MOVIE REVIEW — Knives Out
A New Age Whodunit Done Masterfully — ★★★★1/2
medium.com
The Rise of Skywalker picks up a few years (?) after The Last Jedi, with our band of
resistance fighters scouring the galaxy for intelligence on the growing First Order.
Meanwhile, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)has returned from the grave
following his death in Return of the Jedi, as he calls out to the now Supreme Leader
of the First Order, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). If this is starting to sound fanfiction-like,
just wait, there’s more. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is now training under the Jedi training
from General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) who we learn had a sizable amount of Jedi
training from her brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Now at the helm of the
Millenium Falcon, Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) and Finn (John Boyega) join
Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) in place of former captains Han Solo and Rey, as the
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
opening of the film sees them on the search for a First Order Spy. From here on out,
this review will be dealing in HEAVY SPOILERS, so if you have yet to see the film I
suggest exiting and coming back to read after watching…
Right, so this movie… this fucking movie. Coming out of The Last Jedi <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I felt such a
reinvigorated interest in Star Wars</span> as Rian Johnson did something that others
seemingly feared; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he took a risk</span> (actually, lots of risks). The man knew that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the
franchise needed to evolve</span> after Abrams’ initial revival with The Force Awakens,
which has already been criticized enough for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">just being a rehash of A New Hope</span> (it
really is), and decided to take the leap</span> by doing just that with his entry into the
Skywalker Saga. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Some people obviously were not expecting that</span> and much rather
were expecting Episode VIII to at similarly as a sort-of reboot of The Empire Strikes
Back. Rian Johnson knew that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">should not be the case</span>. Anywho, this is not a review of
The Last Jedi, but the question remains: how would Abrams handle the backlash
that Johnson’s film got while also trying to continue the story AND having to wrap
up a nine film story? By shooting the final installment with an injection of
adrenaline, nostalgia, and retcons of course!

I’m going to try my best to prevent this from becoming rambly or a ranty, but
something has to be said about the handling of the Sequel Trilogy from a creative
standpoint no matter your opinions on the movies. Firstly, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kathleen Kennedy is a
legend and gets more unwarranted hate from “fans” than she deserves</span>… that being
said, why <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the overall story arc for all three films was not laid out BEFORE The Force
Awakens was made</span> is something I have no idea about. I have no issue with different
directors making these movies (see; the Original Trilogy) and frankly, it’s the same
situation with writers (again, see; the Original Trilogy). The franchise has grown
exponentially since the 1970’s and 1980’s with TV shows and other films being
released, with continuity needing to be taken specific care of. If there is one main
issue with The Rise of Skywalker, it is the continuity (or lack thereof) with The Last
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Jedi. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This movie feels like such a loose sequel to Episode VIII, and more of like a
continuation of Episode VII</span>, which is a real shame. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Plot points like Rey’s parentage
are brought back into the focus</span> after <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Johnson provided his answers in that Rey did
NOT need to be anyone special</span>, with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Abrams offering a big sike to that aspect</span>,
opting to just go all out and make her Palpatine’s granddaughter. Similarly, a
character like Rose, who was introduced in The Last Jedi, is given the cold shoulder
both figuratively and literally in the film, just sitting on the sidelines after the
infamous incident with actress Kelly Marie Tran being the victim of targeted
harassment, bullying, and death threats following The Last Jedi. Nice to show
solidarity in the Star Wars family!
Kelly Marie Tran in The Last Jedi (2017)
If that wasn’t enough, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the script is just one hell of a mess</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It isn’t an abomination like
The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">which both featured some of the most
boring writing and worst dialogue of a major motion picture (arguably) to date</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The
Rise of Skywalker is at the very least, engaging and entertaining</span>. That doesn’t change
the fact that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the movie is a mess, with the worst pacing of the Disney Era</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Rarely
does this film slow down for a moment of just talking or any true emotional beats</span>.
Genuinely, the only two I can think of are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the scenes between Kylo and Ben and Rey
and Luke, which just so happen to be two of the best scenes in the film (and actually
are two of my favorite scenes in the entire franchise</span>). For some reason, the choice
was made to make this film a sprint for the entire two hour and twenty two minute
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 5**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
runtime, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">which just left me feeling exhausted as the credits began to roll</span>. I will say, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I
did enjoy the ride much more the second time as I knew what was coming and
wasn’t totally taken out of the movie with the Rey Palpatine reveal</span>.
The Sith Throne from The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
what are some positives about this movie? There has to be some after all
since I did give it three stars… As mentioned above, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the scene with Ben
Solo and Han Solo sharing another moment together on the remains of the Death
Star II is truly amazing, and one of the best the entire series has to offer</span>. It acts as a
reflection of Han’s death scene in The Force Awakens, and features both Harrison
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ford and Adam Driver proving why they are the two best actors in Star Wars</span>.
Similarly, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the scene between Rey and Luke</span> (now a Force ghost) is also fantastic,
outside of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Luke’s “a Jedi’s weapon should never be handled so carelessly” line</span>, which
was clearly written to appease critics of Luke’s portrayal in The Last Jedi. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Luke finally
gets to lift the X-wing</span>, as the music of Yoda and the Force from Empire Strikes Back
swirls to an uproar in a truly iconic moment. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">John Williams’ final Star Wars score is
just as good as ever</span>, and he deservedly earns a cameo in the film as the bartender on
Kijimi. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) is probably my favorite part of the film</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The
character we all know and love finally finds his way back into the main cast</span> after
serving as a background character for several movies across both the Prequels and
Sequels, and in doing so, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">has his best showing in ANY of the Star Wars films</span>.
So
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 6**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Seriously, whoever made the call to give 3PO this treatment deserves a raise because
nearly anytime he talked, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">he had me dying of laughter</span>.
Babu Frik in The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
A List of Random Bits I Loved About the Film:
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Babu Frik is an icon, a king</span>, and he needs to be protected at all costs
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Zori Bliss and Poe Dameron would be great candidates for a Disney+ show</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Finn being force sensitive is something I like</span>, but wish they delved deeper into
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ian McDiarmid is FUCKING terrifying as always as Palpatine here</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Billie Lourd being in these movies</span>… though I wish they did more with her (see;
Booksmart)
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The usage of Carrie Fisher is shockingly good</span> for using unused footage from The
Force Awakens
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Billy Dee Williams as Lando, just yes</span>
The voice cameos of fallen Jedi in the finale
The fact that Porgs made it into this movie
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 7**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Exegol is</span> a dope planet and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the</span> Sith palace has some awesome production
design
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kylo and Rey’s force facetime continuing to evolve from The Last Jedi was
actually awesome</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">was the one thing Abrams and pals did a great job in
building on from Rian Johnson’s film</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ben Solo fighting SO differently than Kylo Ren</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Lightsaber Duel on the Death Star II remains</span>
Kylo Ren Gif from The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
Opinions will always vary on Star Wars, and I doubt the day ever comes where the
fanbase unites and learns to let each other have their opinions, but what can you do?
This series is deeply rooted in pop culture history, continues to rake in money, and
still has a significant fanbase despite what some Episode VIII haters might try to tell
you, so Star Wars isn’t going anywhere. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">If you enjoyed this movie, let others know!</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">People shouldn’t be scared to share their opinions on something they love</span>, whether
they like or dislike an entry into the ongoing saga. Anyways, I’m just a guy who loves
Star Wars, flaws and all, so listen to me or don’t, that choice is yours. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">If you</span> are
looking for some more Star Wars content, I should note that coming in January I will
be doing an entire retrospective on the franchise as a whole, as well as A Look
Ahead to “What Next?” for Star Wars! <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">If that’s something you might be interested in,
be sure to follow me here or over on Twitter</span> (which you can find below). But to
those still reading, May the Force be With You… Always.
