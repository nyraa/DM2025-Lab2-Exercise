REVIEW — Star Wars Episode IX: The\nRise of Skywalker\nA Messy Finale 42 Years in the Making — ★★★☆☆\n9 min read · Dec 24, 2019\nNotVeryProfoundFilm\nFollow\nListen\nShare\nThe Dead Speak! These are the first words seen in the title crawl of Star Wars Episode\nIX (other than the title, obviously) and that one sentence can be applied to the\nentirety of this Disney Era of Star Wars. A seemingly dead film franchise brought\nback from an early 2000’s extinction at the hands of series creator George Lucas with\nthe prequel trilogy. Nothing’s ever really gone though, and so here we are. Five years\nremoved from the arrival of J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens in 2014 and we now have\na total of five new entries into the Star Wars franchise, as well as the arrival of new\nshows such as The Mandalorian on Disney+. Opinions vary on this new set of films\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nfrom love, hate, and totally indifferent, but one thing is certain; everyone has an\nopinion. The difference between the Original and Prequel Trilogies and the Sequel\nTrilogy is their release date. The former were released in times when social media\nwas either not in existence or not prominent at all, whereas with the newest movies,\nfans are able to share their thoughts, both negative and positive, in an instant. This\nlead to the infamous outspoken hatred for Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi from a vocal\nsubset of fans and the rest is history. Star Wars fans have now all been labeled as\ntrashy misogynistic man-children fighting with each other over their supposed\nownership and love of the series. With the fanbase divided headed into the grand\nfinale of the Skywalker Saga, what would J.J. Abrams do to try and bring things\nhome? If you have seen it, you already know, so let’s just get right into it. Here are\nmy thoughts after seeing Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker twice (once in\ndigital and once in IMAX)!\nMOVIE REVIEW — Knives Out\nA New Age Whodunit Done Masterfully — ★★★★1/2\nmedium.com\nThe Rise of Skywalker picks up a few years (?) after The Last Jedi, with our band of\nresistance fighters scouring the galaxy for intelligence on the growing First Order.\nMeanwhile, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)has returned from the grave\nfollowing his death in Return of the Jedi, as he calls out to the now Supreme Leader\nof the First Order, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). If this is starting to sound fanfiction-like,\njust wait, there’s more. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is now training under the Jedi training\nfrom General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) who we learn had a sizable amount of Jedi\ntraining from her brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Now at the helm of the\nMillenium Falcon, Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) and Finn (John Boyega) join\nChewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) in place of former captains Han Solo and Rey, as the\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nopening of the film sees them on the search for a First Order Spy. From here on out,\nthis review will be dealing in HEAVY SPOILERS, so if you have yet to see the film I\nsuggest exiting and coming back to read after watching…\nRight, so this movie… this fucking movie. Coming out of The Last Jedi I felt such a\nreinvigorated interest in Star Wars as Rian Johnson did something that others\nseemingly feared; he took a risk (actually, lots of risks). The man knew that the\nfranchise needed to evolve after Abrams’ initial revival with The Force Awakens,\nwhich has already been criticized enough for just being a rehash of A New Hope (it\nreally is), and decided to take the leap by doing just that with his entry into the\nSkywalker Saga. Some people obviously were not expecting that and much rather\nwere expecting Episode VIII to at similarly as a sort-of reboot of The Empire Strikes\nBack. Rian Johnson knew that should not be the case. Anywho, this is not a review of\nThe Last Jedi, but the question remains: how would Abrams handle the backlash\nthat Johnson’s film got while also trying to continue the story AND having to wrap\nup a nine film story? By shooting the final installment with an injection of\nadrenaline, nostalgia, and retcons of course!\nGet NotVeryProfoundFilm’s stories in your inbox\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\nEnter your email\nSubscribe\nI’m going to try my best to prevent this from becoming rambly or a ranty, but\nsomething has to be said about the handling of the Sequel Trilogy from a creative\nstandpoint no matter your opinions on the movies. Firstly, Kathleen Kennedy is a\nlegend and gets more unwarranted hate from “fans” than she deserves… that being\nsaid, why the overall story arc for all three films was not laid out BEFORE The Force\nAwakens was made is something I have no idea about. I have no issue with different\ndirectors making these movies (see; the Original Trilogy) and frankly, it’s the same\nsituation with writers (again, see; the Original Trilogy). The franchise has grown\nexponentially since the 1970’s and 1980’s with TV shows and other films being\nreleased, with continuity needing to be taken specific care of. If there is one main\nissue with The Rise of Skywalker, it is the continuity (or lack thereof) with The Last\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 4**\n\"\"\"\nJedi. This movie feels like such a loose sequel to Episode VIII, and more of like a\ncontinuation of Episode VII, which is a real shame. Plot points like Rey’s parentage\nare brought back into the focus after Johnson provided his answers in that Rey did\nNOT need to be anyone special, with Abrams offering a big sike to that aspect,\nopting to just go all out and make her Palpatine’s granddaughter. Similarly, a\ncharacter like Rose, who was introduced in The Last Jedi, is given the cold shoulder\nboth figuratively and literally in the film, just sitting on the sidelines after the\ninfamous incident with actress Kelly Marie Tran being the victim of targeted\nharassment, bullying, and death threats following The Last Jedi. Nice to show\nsolidarity in the Star Wars family!\nKelly Marie Tran in The Last Jedi (2017)\nIf that wasn’t enough, the script is just one hell of a mess. It isn’t an abomination like\nThe Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, which both featured some of the most\nboring writing and worst dialogue of a major motion picture (arguably) to date. The\nRise of Skywalker is at the very least, engaging and entertaining. That doesn’t change\nthe fact that the movie is a mess, with the worst pacing of the Disney Era. Rarely\ndoes this film slow down for a moment of just talking or any true emotional beats.\nGenuinely, the only two I can think of are the scenes between Kylo and Ben and Rey\nand Luke, which just so happen to be two of the best scenes in the film (and actually\nare two of my favorite scenes in the entire franchise). For some reason, the choice\nwas made to make this film a sprint for the entire two hour and twenty two minute\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 5**\n\"\"\"\nruntime, which just left me feeling exhausted as the credits began to roll. I will say, I\ndid enjoy the ride much more the second time as I knew what was coming and\nwasn’t totally taken out of the movie with the Rey Palpatine reveal.\nThe Sith Throne from The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\nwhat are some positives about this movie? There has to be some after all\nsince I did give it three stars… As mentioned above, the scene with Ben\nSolo and Han Solo sharing another moment together on the remains of the Death\nStar II is truly amazing, and one of the best the entire series has to offer. It acts as a\nreflection of Han’s death scene in The Force Awakens, and features both Harrison\nFord and Adam Driver proving why they are the two best actors in Star Wars.\nSimilarly, the scene between Rey and Luke (now a Force ghost) is also fantastic,\noutside of Luke’s “a Jedi’s weapon should never be handled so carelessly” line, which\nwas clearly written to appease critics of Luke’s portrayal in The Last Jedi. Luke finally\ngets to lift the X-wing, as the music of Yoda and the Force from Empire Strikes Back\nswirls to an uproar in a truly iconic moment. John Williams’ final Star Wars score is\njust as good as ever, and he deservedly earns a cameo in the film as the bartender on\nKijimi. C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) is probably my favorite part of the film. The\ncharacter we all know and love finally finds his way back into the main cast after\nserving as a background character for several movies across both the Prequels and\nSequels, and in doing so, has his best showing in ANY of the Star Wars films.\nSo\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 6**\n\"\"\"\nSeriously, whoever made the call to give 3PO this treatment deserves a raise because\nnearly anytime he talked, he had me dying of laughter.\nBabu Frik in The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\nA List of Random Bits I Loved About the Film:\nBabu Frik is an icon, a king, and he needs to be protected at all costs\nZori Bliss and Poe Dameron would be great candidates for a Disney+ show\nFinn being force sensitive is something I like, but wish they delved deeper into\nIan McDiarmid is FUCKING terrifying as always as Palpatine here\nBillie Lourd being in these movies… though I wish they did more with her (see;\nBooksmart)\nThe usage of Carrie Fisher is shockingly good for using unused footage from The\nForce Awakens\nBilly Dee Williams as Lando, just yes\nThe voice cameos of fallen Jedi in the finale\nThe fact that Porgs made it into this movie\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 7**\n\"\"\"\nExegol is a dope planet and the Sith palace has some awesome production\ndesign\nKylo and Rey’s force facetime continuing to evolve from The Last Jedi was\nactually awesome and was the one thing Abrams and pals did a great job in\nbuilding on from Rian Johnson’s film\nBen Solo fighting SO differently than Kylo Ren\nThe Lightsaber Duel on the Death Star II remains\nKylo Ren Gif from The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\nOpinions will always vary on Star Wars, and I doubt the day ever comes where the\nfanbase unites and learns to let each other have their opinions, but what can you do?\nThis series is deeply rooted in pop culture history, continues to rake in money, and\nstill has a significant fanbase despite what some Episode VIII haters might try to tell\nyou, so Star Wars isn’t going anywhere. If you enjoyed this movie, let others know!\nPeople shouldn’t be scared to share their opinions on something they love, whether\nthey like or dislike an entry into the ongoing saga. Anyways, I’m just a guy who loves\nStar Wars, flaws and all, so listen to me or don’t, that choice is yours.
